<h1>Cleaning the World - an interactive game</h1>
The App is a project created for the WWDC Swift Student Challenge. The aim of the project is to educate children about the importance of recycling and selective waste collection.

<h3>Installation</h3>
The CleanWorld App is currently only available as a MVP and can be installed by using <h>Swift Playgrounds</h>

<h3>Usage</h3>
Once installed, the Cleaning the World App allows users to switch between different views, including BeachView, TownView, and MangroveView. Each view has its own set of UI elements, animations, and educational content. Users can advance through the educational material by clicking the "Next" button, and the app includes a counter to track the amount of trash collected.

<h3>Technologies</h3>
The CleanWorld App was developed in Swift using the SwiftUI framework. The user interface was built using a combination of ZStack, VStack, and HStack, and the app includes animations and counters to enhance the user experience.

<h3>Future</h3>
In the future, I hope to expand the Cleaning the World App to include more educational content and features, as well as integrating it with social media to raise awareness and encourage greater participation in sustainability efforts.

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
I would like to express my gratitude to the NGO that served as the inspiration for this project. I would also like to thank the WWDC Swift Student Challenge and IFCE Developer Academy for giving me the chance to showcase and further develop my skills, as well as for providing the necessary equipment to create the application.
